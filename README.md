# Encryption and Decryption with Python  

---

This project contains tools for encrypting and decrypting files using the RSA encryption technique. This project is also
a skill showcase.  

This project is based on the [Encryption with Python][link1] guided project. However, all the codes and files present
in this project were created, debugged, and tested by the owner of this repository.  

### How does it work?  

For the encryption process using RSA, two keys are generated. The *private key*, used for decrypting files, and a
*public key*, used for encrypting files. After the keys are generated, they are *serialized*. The process of
**serialization** revolves around the idea of transforming a program memory object into a hard disk memory file, which
can be handled in many ways, shared, and stored for later use.  

After the process of serializing the keys, the file is encrypted. First, the file-to-be-encrypted is loaded into the
program memory, as well as the *public key*. The file is encrypted using the *public key*. The ciphertext generated
by the encryption method is stored as a file, using the same extension of the original one. The decryption follows the
same process but uses the *private key*.
